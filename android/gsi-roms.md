# GSI ROMs

These are my notes only for A/B devices.

These commands don't work in the bootloader, only in fastboot mode.

## What is a GSI ROM?

ELI5 explanation by Microsoft Copilot:
> A GSI (Generic System Image) is a complete Android system image that can be installed on any device supporting Project Treble. Itâ€™s useful for compatibility, testing, and updates, but may lack some device-specific features. Developers often use GSIs for experimentation and customization.

## ROMs

Shy of AndyYans or TrebleDroid AOSP, feels like GSI ROMs aren't really out there. Check [Treble's WIKI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/Generic-System-Image-%28GSI%29-list) the next time I try to find something new again...

1. Boot into fastboot mode(not bootloader)
   * `fastboot reboot fastboot`
